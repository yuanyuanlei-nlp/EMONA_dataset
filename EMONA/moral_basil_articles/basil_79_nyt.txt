WASHINGTON — President Trump on Monday said the F.B.I. ruined the life of his former national security adviser and said his Democratic opponent for president, Hillary Clinton, suffered no consequences after she lied “many times” to the F.B.I.

Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the F.B.I. when he was questioned early this year about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.
He was the fourth person charged in the investigation of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel appointed to lead an inquiry into Russia’s influence on the 2016 election and possible ties to Trump associates.

As he left for Utah on Monday, the president said he felt “very badly” for Mr. Flynn, whom he fired in February for lying to the vice president about the content of these conversations.

Mr. Trump’s comments Monday on Mr. Flynn come at a time when the special counsel investigation is focusing intensely on the president’s inner circle.
Mr. Trump once encouraged Mr. Flynn to seek an immunity deal.
Presidents typically do not weigh in on federal investigations to avoid appearing to influence the outcome.

“I feel badly for General Flynn,” Mr. Trump said on Monday. “I feel very badly.
He’s led a very strong life and I feel very badly.
Hillary Clinton lied many times to the F.B.I. Nothing happened to her.
Flynn lied and they destroyed his life.”

Mr. Trump did not cite specifically what Mrs. Clinton said that he considered a lie.

Mrs. Clinton gave a voluntary interview to the bureau in July 2016 during its investigation into whether she or her aides broke the law by corresponding through a private email server set up for her use as secretary of state.
A few days later, the F.B.I. director at the time, James B. Comey, recommended no charges be filed against her in the matter.
