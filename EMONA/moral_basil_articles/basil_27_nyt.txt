Israel and Middle East policy have a tendency of surfacing in presidential politics in rather combustible ways.
And a new advertisement that will run in areas of Florida with large Jewish populations attempts to stoke anxiety over American policies in the region, using a news clip of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel warning of the risks of a nuclear Iran.

“The fact is that every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to nuclear arms,” Mr. Netanyahu is shown saying.

For dramatic effect, a soundtrack fit for an episodic drama like “Homeland” plays as the prime minister continues.
“The world tells Israel, ‘Wait. There’s still time.’
And I say wait for what?
Wait until when?”
Then an unseen announcer concludes: “The world needs American strength, not apologies.”

That line is a not-so-veiled swipe at President Obama.
Mitt Romney and other Republicans have criticized his foreign policy as apologetic, toward volatile countries like Iran.

The group that produced the ad, Secure America Now, is run by two longtime Republican strategists, Nelson Warfield ? and John ?McLaughlin, and ?Pat Caddell, a former aide to Jimmy Carter who is now a Fox News contributor.
They have reserved $500,000 of airtime in Fort Myers, West Palm Beach and Miami.

A senior Israeli official said the government was not consulted on the ad and did not approve it.
