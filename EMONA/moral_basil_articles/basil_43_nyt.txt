WASHINGTON — It is a lesson politicians never seem to learn from others’ mistakes: The microphone is always on.

The latest candidate to learn the hard way was Representative Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat running for Senate this year.
Mr. Braley apologized to Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and “anyone I may have offended” after video emerged of him warning that “a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school, never practiced law” could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

Mr. Braley is not running against Mr. Grassley, who plans to seek a seventh term in 2016.
But as the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Grassley could assume the chairmanship if his party takes control of the Senate this year.
Mr. Braley, speaking at a January fund-raiser in Corpus Christi, Tex., was explaining why he should go to the Senate instead of his Republican opponent.

America Rising, a conservative political action committee that has vowed to use videos and opposition research to attack Democratic candidates, posted the footage on YouTube on Tuesday.
Other Republicans quickly criticized Mr. Braley.

Though their numbers are declining, farmers are still a powerful force in the Iowa, which ranks second in the country in total farm sales.
Mr. Braley’s apology noted his family’s history with Iowa agriculture, including his own stint “doing farm jobs and working a grain elevator.”

In another appeal to Iowa farmers, Joni Ernst, a candidate in the Republican Senate primary on June 3, announced in an ad that she grew up “castrating hogs on an Iowa farm.”
Ms. Ernst said that qualified her to “cut pork” in Washington.
